A curiosity. This ancient mausoleum (tomb of Sultan Mustafa), was built by King (-) at the time of the construction of Aya Sofya, (-) years before the Prophet. So it is a thousand and (-) years old. While (recently) the master builder and miners, with chisels like that of Farhad, were carving a hole in the south wall to put a window, a fossilized turtle shell appeared between two bricks. All of them saw it, and they could still detect the writings of Kanji characters on it. This is evident proof that burning turtles is an ancient practice.`,

First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the kanji and all their reviews. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the kanji that have been forgotten. When a person fails a session they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears they have 120 new lessons will often swoon or faint. This is the mind’s way of protecting itself from reviews by stepping through the first door.

Second is the door of forgetting. Some kanji are too hard to learn, or too hard to learn quickly. In addition, many memories are simply not good enough, and there is no learning to be done. The saying ‘time teaches all kanji’ is false. Time teaches most kanji. The rest are hidden behind this door.

Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a session it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but reviews, and to escape those reviews the mind must leave reality behind.

Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can make us review us after we are dead, or so we have been told.`,

            `@koichi sat on an egg by the sea. The egg jumped. “I must get something for my baby to review!” he said. So away he went.
Inside the website, the egg jumped. It jumped and jumped and jumped until out came a baby turtle! He looked up at a big “人”. “What is this reading?” he said. He could not read it out loud. “I will go and find out” he said.
He went up to the big character and typed in じん. “Are you my reading?” said the baby turtle. The 人 just looked and looked. It did not say a thing.
The baby turtle typed in "にん”. “No” said the vocab, I am not your reading."
The baby turtle squinted. Maybe it was actually a 入？ “Are you にゅう？” said the baby turtle. “Are you はい？Are you い？” But none of them were his reading.
The baby turtle stopped to think. The にん and the じん were not his reading. にゅう and はい and い were not his reading.
“I have a reading!” said the baby turtle. "I know I do. I will find it. I will. I WILL!"
Just then the baby turtle saw Koichi. “I will type in what I always do when I guess!” said the baby turtle. “こう！” Koichi said, “SNORT!”
”Oh no!“said the baby turtle, “You are not the reading. You are a scary Snort!” Koichi lifted the turtle up, up, up. Then something happened. The correct reading popped into the baby’s head!
“I know what you are” said the baby turtle. You are a ひと！You are not a にん, or a じん, or even a こう！” You are a ひと, and you are my reading!”`,

            `The following anecdote is told of William James. […] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.

“Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it’s wrong. I’ve got a better theory,” said the little old lady.

“And what is that, madam?” inquired James politely.

“That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.”

Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.

“If your theory is correct, madam,” he asked, “what does this turtle stand on?”

“You’re a very clever man, Mr. James, and that’s a very good question,” replied the little old lady, “but I have an answer to it. And it’s this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.”

“But what does this second turtle stand on?” persisted James patiently.

To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,

“It’s no use, Mr. James — it’s turtles all the way down.”`,

            `Cake is the best. Many scholars have thought the same over the last 400 years. However. some scholars have argued the opposite, much to the chagrin of the mainstream scholars. They argue that “Cake is irrelevant” and “Who needs cake”. Such blatantly falsified words require close examination. In the argument that follows, such arguments will be examined and the explanation for the necessity and in fact the worklessness of cake shall be heretofore explored. Many shholars have argued “Cake is not food” or “Cake is bad for your health” or even “Cake is bad for you”. Such scholars miss an essential factor of cake. Ceke is, at its very heart, fun and happiness and piles of bones. Anyone who lives and has no time for cake is in fact, a recluse and a lonesome person and a person whose life has no meaning. Therein lies the answer to the age old question “Is Cake worth it?”
The obvious, and yet easily deniable answer is that cake is a dangerous fiend. Opponents argue “Cake leads to diabetes” further “Cake leads to obesity” and yet again “Cake is death”. But the truth is far from these feathered lies. Cake can be found in the traditions of societies going all the way back to the Incas. Cake was there at the founding and served as the backbone of thousands of cultures from the dawn of time. Cake provides happiness in times of dark forbodding. When all has lost hope, Cake still remains. And so, without further adieu, the council motions for the protection of Cake as a special species who may not be maligned nor mistreated til the end of days. Work shall not be imposed on the Cake lest sadness be imposed on us all. And lest we forget the origins of mother Cake, and thus our own origins, Such chant shall become inherent in our daily meal and in our daily practice: “We thank theee cake, in thee partake, thy organs do we gorge. In happiness, in perfect bliss, all swell with smorgasbord " In such a manner shall the legacy of cake be protected”`,
